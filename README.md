## WHAT IS GIT?
GIT is a version control tool that works by tracking changes in a project's files. It works locally through the add and commit stages to keep a record of file changes.

### WHAT IS GITHUB?
Github is an online repository location that allows you to store your project history online. This greatly encourages collaboration among peers as one repository can be shared by many people, each with their own branch and also a master branch to store the final code. 

Github is well integrated with git through the push, pull and clone stages where we can push our code to online repositories, pull from online repositories or clone an entire repository.

## OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
Object Oriented Programming or OOP in short is a programming technique that allows us to model entities in our systems in form of Classes and objects. This allows us to implement behaviours and functions into our objects more efficiently. In OOP, each object is created from a class and can then be further personalized.

For example, if we look at all modern saloon cars, we find that they all share the following characteristics: 
    1. Have 4 wheels
    2. Have an engine
    3. Have doors, windshield and windows.
    4. Have a handbreak.

And they can all do the following tasks:
    -Move forward
    -Slow down
    -Reverse
    -Doors open.

Implementing this in OOP would entail having a parent Class with a constructor method containing all the similarities of our cars. Then each time we make a car, we can just call our Class and instantly our car will have the set features, from there, we can then personalize the car: is the engine a V6 or V8? do the doors open upwards or sideways? Are the wheels normal size or large?

Without OOP, we would find ourselves repeatedly rewriting the same stuff leaving us with not only a huge codebase but also a messy one.
