## WHAT IS GIT?
GIT is a version control tool that works by tracking changes in a project's files. It works locally through the add and commit stages to keep a record of file changes.

### WHAT IS GITHUB?
Github is an online repository location that allows you to store your project history online. This greatly encourages collaboration among peers as one repository can be shared by many people, each with their own branch and also a master branch to store the final code. 

Github is well integrated with git through the push, pull and clone stages where we can push our code to online repositories, pull from online repositories or clone an entire repository.
